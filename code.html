            <h2> Practical advice on maintaining a healthy diet by WHO </h2>
            <li>
                <p class="sep"> Eating at least 400 g, or five portions, of fruit and vegetables per day reduces the
                    risk of NCDs and helps to ensure an adequate daily intake of dietary fibre.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="sep"> Reducing the amount of total fat intake to less than 30% of total energy intake helps to
                    prevent unhealthy weight gain in the adult population.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="sep"> Most people consume too much sodium through salt and not enough potassium (less than 3.5
                    g). High sodium intake and
                    insufficient potassium intake contribute to high blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of
                    heart disease and stroke.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="sep">Consuming free sugars increases the risk of dental caries (tooth decay). Excess calories
                    from foods and drinks high in free sugars also contribute to unhealthy weight gain, which can lead
                    to overweight and obesity.</p>

            <p class="para">An important way to maintain one's personal health is to have a healthy diet. A healthy diet
                includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods that provide nutrients to the body. Such
                nutrients provide the body with energy and keep it running. Nutrients help build and strengthen bones,
                muscles, and tendons and also regulate body processes (i.e., blood pressure). Water is essential for
                growth, reproduction and good health..</p>

            <img src="2.jpg" alt="exercise" class="sepimg">
            <p class="para">Physical exercise enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. It
                strengthens one's bones and muscles and improves the cardiovascular system. According to the National
                Institutes of Health, there are four types of exercise: endurance, strength, flexibility, and
                balance. The CDC states that physical exercise can reduce the risks of heart disease, cancer, type 2
                diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, depression, and anxiety.</p>

            <img src="3.jpg" alt="smile" class="sepimg">
            <p class="para">When you smile, your brain releases tiny molecules called neuropeptides to help fight off
                stress. Then other neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and endorphins come into play too. The
                endorphins act as a mild pain reliever, whereas the serotonin is an antidepressant. One study even
                suggests that smiling can help us recover faster from stress and reduce our heart rate..</p>
